Resources on cross entropy loss found while reading focal loss paper

Github and paper on improved one-stage object detection via introducing a novel Focal Loss by FAIR:

* https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron

* https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002
Although later learned their model performance was already surpassed by YOLO3, it's still a good paper and a surprisingly simple mathematical solution to improve accuracy

Bakground on Cross-Entropy loss:
* Loss functions https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/loss_functions.html

* Cross Entropy Loss Intro: https://rdipietro.github.io/friendly-intro-to-cross-entropy-loss/ (also in Jupyter Notebook format)


Application of focal loss:
